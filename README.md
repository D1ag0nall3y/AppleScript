# AppleScript

I won't have much content here as I do most of my work in bash. Usually only need to resort to AppleScript to ask for authentication with sudo is required by automator. At some point I will move away from Automator but for really quick services or basic apps, it works for me.

With that being said. These applescripts may not stand on their own as they may require input from Variables within Automator.

I may rewrite or add AppleScript native code to run on its own without need of Automator. But that is for a later date.
